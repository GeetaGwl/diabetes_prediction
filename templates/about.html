                <h2>Diabetes</h2>
                <p>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. Your body either doesn’t make enough insulin
                    or can’t effectively use the insulin it makes.            
                    The hormone insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. If this
                    malfunctions, you may have diabetes.                
                    Untreated high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs. But educating
                    yourself about diabetes and taking steps to prevent or manage it can help you protect your health.

                <h2>Types Of Diabetes</h2>
                <p>Type 1: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. The immune system attacks and destroys cells in the pancreas, where
                insulin is made. It’s unclear what causes this attack.<br>
                Type 2: Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body becomes resistant to insulin, and sugar builds up in your blood. It’s the
                most common type—about 90% to 95%Trusted Source of people living with diabetes have type 2.<br>
                Gestational: Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar during pregnancy. Insulin-blocking hormones produced by the
                placenta cause this type of diabetes.

                <p>The general symptoms of diabetes include: Increased hunger,increased thirst,weight loss,frequent urination,blurry vision,
                    extreme fatigue,sores that don’t heal<br>
                    Symptoms in men: In addition to the general symptoms of diabetes, men with diabetes may have: a decreased sex drive,erectile dysfunction,
                    poor muscle strength<br>
                    Symptoms in women :vaginal dryness,urinary tract infections,yeast infections,dry, itchy skin

                <h2>Causes</h2>
                <p>Type 1 diabetes :Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system
                    mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.               
                    Genes may play a role in some people. It’s also possible that a virus sets off an immune system attack.<br>
                    Type 2 diabetes :stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Having overweight or obesity 
                    increases your risk, too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant
                    to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar.This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that
                    make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.<br>

                <h2>RISK FACTORS</h2>
                <p>Type 1 diabetes :You’re more likely to get type 1 diabetes if you’re a child or teenager, you have a parent or sibling with the condition, 
                    or you carry certain genes that are linked to the disease.
                    Type 2 diabetes :Your risk for type 2 diabetes increases if you:                    
                    are overweight are age 45 or older have a parent or sibling with the condition aren’t physically active have had gestational diabetes
                    have prediabetes have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high triglycerides
                    Type 2 diabetes also disproportionately affects certain racial and ethnic populations.
                    
                    Adults who have African American, Hispanic or Latino American, or Asian American ancestry are more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes than white adults, according to 2016 research. They’re also more likely to experience decreased quality of care and increased barriers to self-management.
                    
                    Type 1.5 diabetes
                    Type 1.5 diabetes is found in adults over 30 and is often mistaken for type 2, but people with this condition are not necessarily overweight, and oral medications and lifestyle changes have no effect.

                    are over age 25
